## The Reality Check

Let me start with some honesty: I'm currently earning 7 LPA at a service company, and I know I'm significantly underpaid for what I bring to the table. After 3 years of building enterprise solutions for clients like ICICI Bank, Capgemini, and Brigade Group, I've realized something important—my skills are worth more, and my impact could be greater in the right environment.

This isn't just about money (though that's definitely part of it). It's about the fundamental difference between building someone else's vision and creating something that can scale and grow.

## What 3 Years in Service Companies Taught Me

### The Good: Real-World Experience at Scale

Working at service companies gave me something you can't get from tutorials or side projects—exposure to enterprise-level systems with real consequences.

**ICICI Bank Projects**: When you're building systems that handle real money for one of India's largest banks, you learn about security, compliance, and the weight of responsibility. Our agreement automation system processes contracts for 82+ branches across 20+ states. When it breaks, it affects thousands of people.

**Multi-Client Architecture**: Managing systems for ICICI Bank, Capgemini, Brigade Group, and World Trade Center simultaneously taught me about scalable architecture, multi-tenancy, and the complexity of enterprise requirements.

**Performance Under Pressure**: Reducing JNPT attendance processing from 4 hours to 30 seconds wasn't just a coding challenge—it was about understanding business processes, optimization, and delivering measurable value.

### The Challenging Parts

**Limited Innovation Scope**: In service companies, you're often implementing someone else's requirements rather than identifying problems and creating solutions. The innovation happens within constraints set by client needs and budgets.

**Revenue Cap Reality**: No matter how much value I create for clients, my compensation is limited by the service company model. When I automated a 3-day process down to 5 minutes for ICICI Bank, the client saved thousands of hours, but my salary remained the same.

**Technology Choices**: Often you're working with whatever the client uses or whatever's cheapest, not necessarily what's best for solving the problem.

## Why Product Companies Appeal to Me Now

### Ownership of Impact

In product companies, when you improve something by 93% (like I did with video load times), you're directly contributing to user experience and business growth. Your optimizations can affect millions of users, not just one client's workflow.

### Technology-First Decisions

Product companies can choose the best technology for the problem, not just what fits the client's existing infrastructure. This means working with modern stacks, exploring new solutions, and building for scale from the ground up.

### Growth Aligned with Value

When the product succeeds, everyone succeeds. Your contributions directly impact the company's growth, which can translate to better compensation, equity, and career advancement.

## The Skills That Transfer (And What I Need to Learn)

### What I'm Bringing

- **Enterprise-grade thinking**: Understanding security, compliance, and scalability from day one
- **Performance optimization**: Real experience making systems faster and more efficient
- **Problem-solving under constraints**: Years of figuring out how to make things work with limited resources
- **Client communication**: Translating technical solutions into business value

### What I'm Actively Learning

- **Product thinking**: Moving from "how do I build this requirement" to "what should we build and why"
- **Modern development practices**: CI/CD pipelines, cloud-native architectures, and developer productivity tools
- **User-centric design**: Understanding metrics that matter for product growth, not just client satisfaction
- **System design at scale**: Preparing for interviews with companies like Google, Meta, and product startups

## The Transition Strategy

### Target Companies

I'm focusing on:
- **Product startups** (better compensation than traditional service companies)
- **Mental health tech companies** (aligns with my MindShift app development)
- **Companies with behavioral design teams** at Google, Meta, Microsoft

### Avoiding the Obvious Traps

**Not targeting traditional service companies** like TCS, Infosys, Wipro—that would just be moving sideways without addressing the fundamental issues.

### Salary Expectations

Moving from 7 LPA to 15-25 LPA based on:
- Enterprise client experience (ICICI Bank carries weight)
- Pan-India deployment experience (architect-level responsibility)
- Measurable impact (95% time reductions, 93% performance gains)
- Product development experience (my MindShift app)

## What This Means for My Work

### Current Projects

Even while job searching, I'm treating my current role differently:
- **Building in public**: Sharing my MindShift app development journey
- **Focusing on metrics**: Documenting not just what I built, but the impact it had
- **Modern practices**: Using the latest tools and techniques where possible

### Personal Branding

- **Portfolio evolution**: Positioning myself as an "AI-focused developer" rather than just a "software developer"
- **Content strategy**: Writing about the intersection of psychology and technology
- **Open source**: Contributing to projects that demonstrate product thinking

## The Honest Truth About This Transition

This isn't easy. Product companies have higher bars for technical interviews, expect different thinking patterns, and move faster than service companies. I'm spending evenings doing LeetCode, reading system design books, and building personal projects.

But here's what I've learned: **the skills I've built solving real problems for real clients are exactly what product companies need.** They want people who can ship working software, understand user impact, and have experience with systems at scale.

## What's Next

I'm targeting a transition within the next 6 months. My preparation includes:
- **50 LeetCode medium problems** (currently at 23)
- **System design study** (reading "Designing Data-Intensive Applications")
- **MindShift app MVP** (demonstrating product development skills)
- **Portfolio optimization** (showcasing enterprise experience effectively)

## For Others Making This Transition

If you're in a similar position, here's what I wish someone had told me earlier:

1. **Don't underestimate your service company experience**—enterprise clients and real-world constraints are valuable
2. **Start building personal projects now**—they demonstrate product thinking
3. **Learn to talk about business impact**—not just technical implementation
4. **Network with people at product companies**—understand their challenges and culture
5. **Be prepared for different interview styles**—product companies test differently than service companies

## The Bottom Line

After 3 years in service companies, I'm grateful for the foundation they gave me. But I'm ready for the next chapter—one where my work can have broader impact, where I can grow alongside the product, and where my compensation reflects the value I create.

The transition won't be easy, but neither was reducing a 4-hour process to 30 seconds. Sometimes the best solutions require changing your approach entirely.
